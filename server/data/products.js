    description: '"Motion Heat Cutter" is a 3D model sculpture integrating motion detection to activate a nichrome wire that burns at 400 degrees fahrenheit through a tilt ball switch. This interactive tool, allowing users to rotate it 90 degrees, was crafted with the purpose of sculpting a foam representation critiquing the gluttony of the TransAtlantic Slave trade and the exploitation of black labor in sugar production. By juxtaposing foam with sugar as materials, the piece unveils the hidden exploitative nature underlying the commodification of sugar, urging contemplation on the complexities of industrialization and exploitation within our societal structures.',

At its core is Luke Kane, a former artistic prodigy turned Nexrunner, who finds himself at the center of a conspiracy to reshape the human soul through the Transcendence Protocol. In a world teetering on the edge of control and chaos, ancient technologies, unspoken horrors, and complex alliances bring both beauty and destruction into the balance. For now you can explore character and world-building designs that allude to a story where hope, betrayal, and the relentless march of progress collide.`,
